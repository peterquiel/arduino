# Liquid Level Measurement

A program to measure the liquid in a partly filled lying cylinder like tank. 

I use a [liquid crystal display](https://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/LCD-Blue-I2C) to show how much the tank is filled.
Furthermore, I use a [Ultra Sonic
Sensor](http://www.tautvidas.com/blog/2012/08/distance-sensing-with-ultrasonic-sensor-and-arduino/) to measure the
distance from the top of the tank to the liquid surface.
